# Trees

## summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a Node class that has two property the left child node, and the right child node, and Create a BinaryTree class has methods called `preOrder`, `inOrder`, and `postOrder`, Create a BinarySearchTree class has `add` and `contains` methods. 

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
1. Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.<br>

2. Create a BinaryTree class Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called `preOrder`, `inOrder`, and `postOrder` which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.<br>

3. Create a BinarySearchTree class:
* Define a method named `add` that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
* Define a method named `contains` that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.

<!-- O(Log n) -->
